# Employees_Attrition_Prediction
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for predicting and analyzing employee attrition using machine learning. The project utilizes five machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Descent XGBoost Classifier, and Gradient Descent LightGBM Classifier—to predict employee turnover based on key features. Feature importance analysis is conducted using algorithm-based, permutation-based, and SHAP methods to identify the main drivers of attrition, including OverTime, Job Level, Years in Current Role, Age, and Job Role.

The project also includes graphical analysis of attrition trends, such as Job Satisfaction vs Attrition Distribution, Job Involvement vs Attrition Distribution, and Age vs Attrition Distribution, offering visual insights into key patterns that influence turnover. The findings can be leveraged to develop data-driven retention strategies and improve workforce stability.

A web-based deployment allows HR professionals to make real-time predictions and interventions based on employee attributes, fostering evidence-based management for long-term organizational success.
