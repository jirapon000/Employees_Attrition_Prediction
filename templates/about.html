            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Our model analyzes key employee data—such as overtime, years in current role, job level, 
                and more—to predict the likelihood of attrition. This enables HR teams to act early 
                and implement targeted strategies to retain valuable talent.

                According to our analysis, these factors are among the most predictive of attrition. 
                They often reflect an employee’s workload, stability, and career progression—critical elements that 
                influence whether someone stays or leaves. By focusing on these signals, our tool empowers organizations 
                to make smarter, data-backed HR decisions.
